# Sentence Complete
Supervised by Professor Deepak Kumar from Bryn Mawr College, Sentence Complete is my first independent research about natural language processing. Through this research, I hope to learn the basic theories about NPL, such as N-grams, and make a sentence complete or next word suggestion applet, maybe in Android platform. I am currently using the N-gram data provided by Google, which is a bit messy and hard to deal with. I might considering switch to other data sources in the future, but I am trying to stick with the Google one. (Yay Google!) The data file is about 25 GB and too big to put on GitHub, but you can definitely check the programs and give suggestions about the approach I take.
